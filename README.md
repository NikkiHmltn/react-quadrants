## Overview

#### What is this homework?

Today we're going to work with some starter code that pulls from an API and refactor it!

**The objective of this homework is to:**

* Refactor this starter code to practice working with API calls.
* Familiarize yourself with React hooks and passing data.

#### Your tasks to complete this homework are as follows:

1) Fork & clone down this repo for React Quadrants.

2) Two of your quadrants must pull random API data from Giphy's API and display it.

3) One quadrant must have a [Kawaii](https://react-kawaii.now.sh/) of your choice in it. The Kawaii will be sad until ALL API calls have been made, and then it will be happy! 

4) One quadrant will have a button to fetch API calls again.

## Hungry for More

5) If the API call fails, implement some error handling and make your Kawaii quadrant "ko".

6) If an error occurs, display a message for the user

7) Add more Sections for more images!

8) Make more Sections for an API of your choice! 

**Good luck and have fun!**
